# YZU LINE Chatbot

I have built a chatbot within the LINE app that helps people who are unfamiliar with YZU University. This chatbot is designed to provide accurate and quick information about the university, including details about its programs, campus facilities, admission process, and more. By offering fast responses to various inquiries, the chatbot makes it easier for prospective students, visitors, or anyone interested in YZU to get the information they need without delay, enhancing their understanding and experience of the university.
